# Technical Challenge - Lalamove
## Tech/Infrastructure Intern

## Result
- I just learned golang for this test. I would like to implement concurrency in the future, but it's finals period in HKUST, so I don't have time to learn and implement it.
- I tried to minimize the API calls by using manual functions for simple tasks.
- I added some test cases, more explanation in the comments.
- For the output I added a newline character to make the output readable. I don't know if this will cause a problem or not.
- Thank you for the opportunity! :)
